# Celestial Mechanics Simulation 

> **Note:** This project was carried out with **Élodie Sorée** for the Numerical Simulation in Physics course at UCLouvain in 2024.

This project aims to model celestial mechanics and compare the Heun method with the Störmer-Verlet method.  

## Contents  

This repository contains four main code files:  

- **Plots - 3-body system**: Generates plots of various system parameters and the trajectories of the Sun, Saturn, and Jupiter.  
- **Animation - Sun, Jupiter, and Saturn**: Creates an animated visualization of these three celestial bodies.  
- **Animation - Solar System**: Simulates and animates the trajectories of all planets in the solar system.  
- **Customizable Two-Body System**: Simulates the motion of two celestial bodies with user-defined parameters such as mass, initial position, and momentum.  

Additionally, two video files showcase the animation of the three planets mentioned above. These visualizations highlight that the Störmer-Verlet method is significantly more stable than the Heun method.
